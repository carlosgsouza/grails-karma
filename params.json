{"name":"grails-karma","tagline":"Run javascript tests in the Grails build","body":"The main goal for Karma is to bring a productive environment for javascript testing. \r\nThe grails-karma plugin integrates this spectacular tool with Grails so unit and functional tests written in javascript can be executed during the build.\r\n\r\n## Instalation\r\nFirst, install Karma as described in the [Karma's official documentation](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html). \r\nMake sure karma is on your path and working properly.\r\nThen execute the following command to install the grails-karma plugin <code>grails install-plugin grails-karma</code>.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\ngrails-karma is ready to be executed right after its installation. \r\nJust put your test files under the <code>test/js-unit/</code> or <code>test/js-functional/</code> directories and execute <code>grails test-app</code>.\r\nYou can also use <code>grails test-app karma:unit</code> or <code>grails test-app karma:functional</code> to execute tests form a specific phase.\r\n\r\n*During development, I recommend using karma directly form the command line since it will execute tests for you as you change your files.*\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nThe default karma configuration uses [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) as the testing framework and [Angular](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) to interact with the browser on functional tests.\r\nYou can change any settings in the <code>unit.conf.js</code> and <code>functional.conf.js</code> files under <code>conf/karma</code>. \r\nThere are only a few items, followed by a <code>// can't touch this</code> comment, which the plugin relies on and should be left alone.\r\n\r\n*Don't worry aobut setting <code>autoWatch</code>. grails-karma will override this option so tests are executed only once during the Grails build.*\r\n\r\n## About this project\r\nThis is just the first version of this plugin and we are couting on your feedback to make this plugin better! \r\nDon't hesitate to send us an e-mail, create an issue on GitHub or, even better, submit a pull request. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
