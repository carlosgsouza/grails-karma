Grails-karma allows Grails developers to use this spectacular tool in their application so they can write unit and functional tests in Javascript and execute them in the build.\r\n\r\n## Instalation\r\nFirst, install and configure Karma as described in [Karma's official documentation](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html).\r\n\r\nAfter you have karma running on your machine, you can install the grails-karma plugin by adding this dependency to your BuildConfig.groovy\r\n\r\n> code here\r\n\r\nor using the install-plugin command\r\n\r\n> grails install-plugin grails-karma\r\n\r\nWhen installed, grails-karma will create the following files in your project tree\r\n> config files\r\n\r\nthe following directories will also be created:\r\n> js-unit and functional\r\n\r\nFor grails-karma to function properly, please make sure you have karma on your path.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\ngrails-karma itself doesn't need to be configured. All configuration is made using karma configuration files under the conf/karma directory. These files have a very useful default configuration. Please refer to the karma official documentation(http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html) for more information.\r\n\r\nYou may configure your karma tests they way you want by changing the configuration files under conf/karma. However, make sure you don't change any of the following configuration parameters used by the plugin:\r\n> test-report\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nTo run the karma plugin, use \r\n> grails test-app karma:unit\r\n> grails test-app karma:functional\r\n\r\nor simply grails test-app\r\n\r\nBy default, grails-karma will look for javascript tests under the directories js-unit and js-functional and for javascript code under the directory â€¦\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
